Description: High-performance package for SemiDefinite Programs
 The software SDPA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm) is one of the most
 efficient and stable  software packages for solving SDPs based on the
 primal-dual interior-point method.
 SDP (SemiDefinite Program) is used for financial engineering, machine
 learning, control theory, sensor network problem, quantum chemistry,
 quantum information, combinatorial optimizaiton, polynomial
 optimization, and so on.
 Further information on SDP and SDPA can be found at
 http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/

Description: Matlab/Octave interface of SDPA
 This package provides SDPA-M, Matlab/Octave interface 
 of SDPA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm).
 See the information of the package 'sdpa'.
 To use SDPA-M on Octave, add /usr/share/sdpa/mex and /usr/lib/sdpa/mex
 to your Octave path.
 The summary of each command can be found in
 /usr/share/sdpa/mex/CommandList.txt
 The compilation by Matlab can be found at
 /usr/share/doc/sdpa/README.
